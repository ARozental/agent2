config:
    sequence_lengths = [16, 16, 6, 3, 4]
    vector_sizes = [32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 156]
    num_heads = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

    batch = 64 sentences

level 0 learns well from the start, except Coherence
level 1 only learns join&EoS from the start and a bit of reconstruction_diff but not reconstruction
at 45K steps 90% of loss is reconstruction1 and mlm1
